The latest version of the JDK can't be downloaded within a script due to the need to accept a license agreement. To make this role work, you must:

1. Download the latest version of the JDK RPM (i.e. from [Oracle's website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html))
2. Rename the JDK to jdk.rpm and place it in the "files" directory for this role
